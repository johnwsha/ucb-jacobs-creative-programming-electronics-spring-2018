### Homework 10 (due Tuesday, April 3, 2018)

Your final project work will include a few deliverables over the next five weeks: a proposal, a progress report, an alpha version, and a final version plus documentation.

Next week, your project proposal will be due. Feel free to be ambitious in your proposal -- we'll provide feedback and work with you to narrow your scope if it's too much work to complete by May 3!

If you'd like some inspiration, take a look at [this list of inspiring videos](../README.md#Inspiration) from day 1.

#### Final Project Proposal

Prepare a proposal for your final project.

- **Assignment**: Create a new GitHub repository for your team's final project, and modify the README.md file to include your project proposal. To learn about formatting text in markdown `.md` files, read [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) and look at the [project proposal template](proposal-template.md). Make sure to share your repository among your collaborators. (You're also free to create a new GitHub "organization" for your final project team if you like!)

  I've created a [sample project proposal](sample-proposal.md) for your perusal.

  Your proposal should be thoughtful and complete, and should take into consideration any feedback you received from me and your classmates. You can always modify what you're doing later on, but your proposal should describe a complete project.

  The final project is your opportunity to put to work what you've learned so far in class, and to build the skills you're most interested in taking with you from this course.

- **Assignment**: Make a group for your team in [bCourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1470326/groups#tab-62529) It will appear in the category Student Groups, later we will go in and transfer these to Final Project groups. Something inconvenient about bCourses we just learned... sorry for any confusion! From the bCourses class web page, click People in the left menu, then Groups in the tab bar, then +Group in the upper right.

- **Assignment**: Post your proposal's **Summary** section in the [Project Forum on bCourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1470326/discussion_topics/5338312) and provide feedback to your classmates.

Finally, a few words of advice: team projects work best when everyone on the team is invested in the project. Come up with an idea *together*, and make sure that you're exicted by what your team is working on! Make use of your different skills and backgrounds to create something interdisciplinary that's well-suited to your team's abilities.
